Convert to Mobile App (Optional)
You can turn this into an Android APK using Kivy or Flutter + TensorFlow Lite.

Using Kivy
pip install kivy kivymd
Then, build a simple UI that captures images and displays predictions.

Convert Model to TensorFlow Lite (For Mobile Apps)
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model("personality_model.h5")
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

with open("personality_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

Now, you can integrate it into a mobile app using Flutter, Android Studio, or Kivy.

Install Required Libraries for Age Estimation using Deep Learning
pip install deepface opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy

Facial Language Analysis (Emotion Recognition)
Facial language (expressions) can indicate emotions. We'll use DeepFace for this.
def analyze_facial_language(image_path):
    try:
        analysis = DeepFace.analyze(image_path, actions=['emotion'])
        emotion = analysis[0]['dominant_emotion']
        return f"Facial Language: {emotion}"
    except:
        return "Facial Language Analysis Failed"

# Test
print(analyze_facial_language("sample.jpg"))

Supported Emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Neutral, Disgust.





Supported Emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Neutral, Disgust.
